# FastList
FastList is an easy-to-use iOS application to manage list of items, e.g., to-do, work, grocery, movies, etc.  FastList dynamically changes the contents of the list based on location and due date.  FastList eliminates the need to manage multiple lists of items, saving users time and making sure that items do not get lost in the sea of lists.
